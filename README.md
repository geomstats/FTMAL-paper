# FTMAL-paper

This is the companion repository to the paper [**Introduction to Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Statistics: from basic theory to implementation with Geomstats**](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03766900v1) by **Nicolas Guigui, Nina Miolane** and **Xavier Pennec**, to appear in *Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning* in Januray 2023.

The goal of this repo is to keep updated all the code samples from the paper to ensure compatibility with future releases of the [geomstats](https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats) package.

Feel free to open an issue or contact us if you have any questions or comment!
